### Write-Up Template for Documenting and Sharing Resolved Issues

#### Introduction

As part of our continuous effort to improve our project and streamline the development process, we encourage all team members to document and share solutions to issues they encounter and successfully resolve. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive knowledge base that can assist current and future team members in troubleshooting similar problems more efficiently.

#### Process Overview

If you encounter an issue during your development work and manage to resolve it, please document the steps you took and any relevant information that led to the solution. Clear and detailed documentation can significantly benefit the team by reducing the time spent on recurring issues. Once documented, please upload your write-up to the `issues/errors` folder in our GitHub repository. I will review the submissions, and if the documentation meets our clarity and completeness standards, it will be added to our project's official documentation so that everyone can benefit from it.

#### Documentation Guidelines

**Title**: Provide a concise and descriptive title for the issue.

**Description**:
- **Brief Overview**: Start with a summary of the problem, including any error messages encountered.
- **Environment**: Note the development environment where the issue occurred, including OS, software versions, and relevant configurations.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. List the steps taken that led to the issue, aiming for clarity and precision so that others can replicate the problem if needed.

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Detail the steps you took to resolve the issue, including commands run, settings changed, or links to resources that provided a solution.
2. Include explanations for why specific steps were taken, if possible, to provide insight into the problem-solving process.

**Supporting Resources**:
- **Images**: If applicable, include screenshots or diagrams that illustrate the problem or solution. Ensure images are clear and annotated if necessary.
- **Links**: Provide links to any external resources, documentation, or forums that contributed to resolving the issue.

**Conclusion**:
- Summarize the key takeaways and, if applicable, suggest any preventive measures or best practices to avoid similar issues in the future.

#### Submission Instructions

- Create a new document within the `issues/errors` folder of our GitHub repository. Name the file descriptively, based on the issue's title.
- Use Markdown (.md) format for your document to ensure readability and support for images and hyperlinks.
- Commit your document with a message that briefly describes the issue, e.g., "Documenting resolution for [issue title]."
- Submit a pull request for your document. In the pull request description, provide a brief overview of the issue and its resolution.

#### Review and Approval Process

I will review submitted documents for clarity, completeness, and adherence to our guidelines. Approved documents will be merged into the main branch and become part of our official project documentation. Contributors of approved documentation will be acknowledged, and their efforts will significantly benefit the entire team.

#### Conclusion

Your contributions to documenting resolved issues are invaluable to our team's success and efficiency. By sharing our collective knowledge, we can foster a collaborative and supportive development environment. If you have any questions about this process or need assistance with your documentation, please feel free to reach out.
